guid_database.py
================

Persistent store of all GUIDs that are already used by the user's mods.

Every supported game (see ``GAMES`` in constants.py) has its OWN database
file, e.g. ``guid_database_anno1800.json`` and ``guid_database_anno117.json``.
One :class:`GuidDatabase` instance is created per game.

The database is a JSON file mapping each GUID (as string) to an entry with
the mod-relative XML files it was found in and an optional comment::

    {
        "2144009900": {
            "comment": "Praefectus Specialists Name",
            "locations": ["data/config/gui/texts_*.xml"]
        },
        "1337471142": {
            "comment": "",
            "locations": ["data/config/export/main/asset/assets.xml"]
        }
    }

GUID collisions
---------------
A GUID whose locations belong to MORE THAN ONE mod (the folder above
``data/``, see :func:`mod_of_location`) is a collision – e.g. two alternative
versions of a mod that reuse the same GUID. When the user accepts such a
collision during an import, the mods involved are stored, so the same
collision is not reported again (a third mod would be)::

    "2144009900": {
        "comment": "...",
        "locations": ["[Mod] v1/data/...", "[Mod] v2/data/..."],
        "accepted_mods": ["[Mod] v1", "[Mod] v2"]
    }

Two more kinds of collision are stored as lists in the entry:

* ``duplicate_in`` – mods that define the GUID more than once themselves
  (two asset definitions, or twice in one texts_*.xml file). Updated on
  every import of the mod, so it disappears once the mod is fixed.
* ``reserved_in`` – "Free GUIDs" lists (other mod projects) in which the
  GUID was still reserved when the user accepted the import. Shown as a
  collision only while the GUID is still reserved there.

``accepted_mods``, ``duplicate_in`` and ``reserved_in`` are only written for
GUIDs that have them.

Older database files stored only the location list per GUID
(``"1337471142": ["assets.xml"]``). They are converted to the new format
automatically when loaded and written in the new format on the next save.

It serves two purposes:

1. Overview / search of all used GUIDs (tab "GUID Database").
2. Collision avoidance: when real GUIDs are assigned to dummies or a free
   block is suggested, every GUID that already exists in the database is
   skipped. GUIDs that are only reserved (tab "Free GUIDs", see
   guid_reservations.py) are passed in as ``extra_taken`` and skipped too.
